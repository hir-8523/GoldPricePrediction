## Project Overview
The project utilizes historical gold price data to build a predictive model. The main steps include:
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Model Selection and Training
- Evaluation and Optimization

## Dataset
The dataset contains historical gold prices with various financial indicators. It includes:
- Date (converted to datetime format)
- Gold price values
- Other relevant financial metrics

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gold-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd gold-price-prediction
   ```
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook "gold price prediction.ipynb"
   ```

## Model Training
The project uses machine learning algorithms such as:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost

## Results
The trained model is evaluated using performance metrics such as:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-Squared Score
